# User Interface

## EditorCopy

Copy the selected text to the clipboard.

## EditorCut

Cut the text selection to the clipboard.


## EditorPaste

Insert the clipboard contents on the command-line.

## EditorSearch

Incremental search in the text editor.


## Wait

Wait for a key press or a time lapse.

When the argument is greater than 0, interrupt the program for the given number
of seconds, which can be fractional.

When the argument is 0 or negative, wait indefinitely until a key is
pressed. The key code for the key that was pressed will be pushed in the
stack. If the argument is negative, the current menu will be displayed on the
screen during the wait.

For example, the following program will count for approximately 3 seconds:

```rpl
1 30 for i
   i 1 disp
   0.1 wait
next
```

## Prompt

Display a message in the header area, then stop the currently executing program
to wait for user input. The user should press the `Run` key to resume execution
once the user has performed the requested operations.

For example, the following program displays a message at the top of the screen,
then waits for the user to put a number on the stack and hit the `Run` key. The
program then deposits the next number on the stack.

```rpl
«
	"Enter number then press Run" Prompt
    1 +
    "Next number" →Tag
»
```

Once you run the program, you can type a value, then use the `Run` key left of
`+` to resume execution:

```rpl
123
```


## Input

Prompts for data input to the command line and prevents the user access to stack
operations.

When `INPUT` is executed, the stack or history area is blanked and program
execution is suspended for data input to the command line. The contents of the
prompt argument are displayed at the top of the screen. Depending on the second
argument, the command line may also contain the contents of a string, or it may
be empty.

Pressing _ENTER_ resumes program execution and returns the contents of the
command line in string form.

The command line argument can be a text, which defines the original content of
the command line, or a list containing up to three elements:

* The object defining the initial content of the command line
* A cursor position on the command line, the index starting at 1, where 0 is the
  end of the command-line; or a list or array containing the row and column,
  starting at 1, where 0 indicates the end of of the row or the last column.
* A validation object

The validation object indicates how the input is validated. If the validation
object is a text or symbol, it can be one of the following (the comparison being
case-insensitive):

* `α`, `alpha` or `text` selects text mode and enable alpha mode. The
  value is retured as text.
* `alg`, `algebraic` or `expression` selects algebraic mode, which can be used
  to to enter an expression. The value is returned as text for `alg` (for
  compatibility with HP), as an algebraic value (including numbers) if
  `algebraic` is used, as an expression object for `expression` is used.
* `value` or `object` checks that the command line describes a single valid RPL
  program. That object is returned on the stack.
* `v`, `values` or `objects` checks that the command line describes a valid RPL
  syntax, which may contain any sequence of objects. The result is returned as
  text, which can be evaluated using `Obj→`. This mode is compatible with the HP
  usage.
* `p`, `prog` or `program` checks that the command line is a valid sequence of
  commands in RPL syntax, and returns a program object, as if the user input had
  been surrounded by `«»`
* `n` or `number` checks that the input is a numerical value, which includes
  integers, decimal, fractions and complex numbers, and returns the numerical
  values on the stack.
* `r` or `real` checks that the input is a real numerical value.
* `i` or `integer` checks that the input is an integer numerical value, which
  can be positive or negative.
* `positive` or `natural` checks that the input is a positive numerical
  value.

In the more general case, the validation program is a program that returns a
truth value. The input is only accepted after the program returns a true value.
